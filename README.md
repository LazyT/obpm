# **Omron Blood Pressure Manager for M500IT**

## Description

Tired of Omrons original software because it's only available for Windows and requires an internet connection for uploading your private health data into the cloud? Then try OBPM for free and use it on Windows, Linux and MacOS!

The current version supports the following features:

* import blood pressure and heart rate via usb from the device and keep it private on your pc
* export to csv/pdf documents or print it
* analyse, zoom, set time range, change diagram type, see minimum/average/maximum values
* multi language (English and German at the moment, translators welcome)

##### Hint for Linux users

If you get permission denied errors you should create a udev rule:

* disconnect device
* create file (e.g. "/etc/udev/rules.d/99-obpm.rules") as root and add the following line

		KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0590", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0090", MODE="0666"

* reconnect device
