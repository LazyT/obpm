# **Omron Blood Pressure Manager**

## Description

Tired of Omrons original software because it's only available for Windows and requires an internet connection for uploading your private health data into the cloud? Then try OBPM for free and use it on Windows, Linux and MacOS!

The current version supports the following features:

* Omron HEM-7322U (M500 IT, M6 Comfort IT) and HEM-7131U (M400 IT, M3 IT)
* import blood pressure and heart rate via usb from device or csv/sql files and keep it private on your pc
* export to csv/sql/pdf documents or print it
* analyse, zoom, set time range, change diagram type, see minimum/average/maximum values
* context sensitive help via F1 key
* online update notification
* multi language (English and German at the moment, translators welcome)
* cross platform (same look & feel on Windows, Linux, MacOS)
* implementation of 'irregular hearbeats'
* user data removal
